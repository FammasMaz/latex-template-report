  abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh–Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

Numerical simulation of superficial wear requires the implementation of computational tools for calculation of dissipated power during loaded contacts of roller on track cam [1]. Uncertainties due to geometrical defects or to not well known parameters such as the friction ratio for example, yield to a probabilistic approach [2] of the contact problem. Number of simulated cases becomes very important and cannot reasonably be treated by the exact approach which leads to long CPU time. A simplified approach was chosen to calculate the dissipated power for non-hertzian case generated by the wear. To quantify the precision of this approach, we present and discuss the choices which had been made. In particular, the simplified approach proposed by Kalker [3] is compared with the solutions of the exact approach, then we propose improvement of semi-hertzian approaches which are presented in [4] or [5].},

  abstract = {When predicting rolling noise due to wheel and rail roughness a ‘‘contact filter’’ is generally applied to account for the effect of the finite size of the wheel/rail contact. For time-domain analysis these calculations must be fast enough to get results in a reasonable time. Remington and Webb have devised a versatile three-dimensional ‘distributed point reacting spring’ (DPRS) contact model that is relatively quick, but if only one line of data is available along the contact it is unnecessarily complex, so a simpler two-dimensional version has been developed here. When this new model was checked against a Boussinesq analysis of the contact, the results in one-third octave bands were found to agree to within 3 dB. These results further suggest that the two-dimensional DPRS model might have an unexpectedly wide range of applicability, including large amplitude sinusoidal roughness and discrete features such as a rail joint. When implemented at each step in a time-domain wheel/rail interaction analysis, this model gave similar results to quasi-static roughness filtering with a constant load for moderate roughness, but dynamic effects became significant when the roughness amplitudes were large, particularly with dipped rail joints.},

  abstract = {Aeronautical structures are commonly assembled with bolted joints in which friction phenomena, in combination with slapping in the joint, provide damping on the dynamic behavior. Some models, mostly nonlinear, have consequently been developed and the harmonic balance method (HBM) is adapted to compute nonlinear response functions in the frequency domain. The basic idea is to develop the response as Fourier series and to solve equations linking Fourier coefficients. One specific HBM feature is that response accuracy improves as the number of harmonics increases, at the expense of larger computational time. Thus this paper presents an original adaptive HBM which adjusts the number of retained harmonics for a given precision and for each frequency value. The new proposed algorithm is based on the observation of the relative variation of an approximate strain energy for two consecutive numbers of harmonics. The developed criterion takes the advantage of being calculated from Fourier coefficients avoiding time integration and is also expressed in a condensation case. However, the convergence of the strain energy has to be smooth on tested harmonics and this constitutes a limitation of the method. Condensation and continuation methods are used to accelerate calculation. An application case is selected to illustrate the efficiency of the method and is composed of an asymmetrical two cantilever beam system linked by a bolted joint represented by a nonlinear LuGre model. The practice of adaptive HBM shows that, for a given value of the criterion, the number of harmonics increases on resonances indicating that nonlinear effects are predominant. For each frequency value, convergence of approximate strain energy is observed. Emergence of third and fifth harmonics is noticed near resonances both on vibratory responses and on approximate strain energy. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the excitation force amplitude and the threshold value of the adaptive algorithm. Maximal amplitudes of vibration and frequency response functions are plotted for three different points of the structure. Nonlinear effects become more predominant for higher force amplitudes and consequently the number of retained harmonics is increased.},

To evaluate the fatigue life of jointed rails, it is necessary to verify the stress distribution around fish-bolt holes and an S-N curve of jointed rails. Therefore, we carried out static loading tests in a laboratory and field tests to measure the stresses around the fish-bolt holes, and further dynamic stress analysis of jointed rails and bending fatigue tests of rails used in the field. The dynamic stress analysis model is composed of a beam model to calculate dynamic wheel/rail contact forces and a solid model to calculate stress distribution resulting from those contact forces. These models were validated using field test data. Based on the study results, we established a method to evaluate the fatigue life of jointed rails. In this method, we calculated the stresses under several combined conditions of jointed rail, vehicle type and vehicle speeds. The fatigue life was calculated by applying the stresses to the S-N curve. As a result, the rail replacement period have a potential to be extended except in cases of heavy wear between a fishplate and rail.},

  abstract = {High-cycle fatigue caused by large resonance stresses remains one of the most common causes of turbine blade failures. Friction dampers are one of the most effective and practical solutions to limit the vibration amplitudes, and shift the resonance frequencies of the turbine assemblies far from operating speeds. However, predicting the effects of underplatform dampers on the dynamics of the blades with good accuracy still represents a major challenge today, due to the complex nature of the nonlinear forces at the interface, characterised by transitions between stick, slip, and separation conditions. The most common modelling approaches developed recently are based on the explicit FE model for the damper, and on a dense grid of 3D contact elements comprised of Jenkins elements, or on a single 2D microslip element on each surface. In this paper, a combination of the two approaches is proposed. A 3D microslip element, based on a modified Valanis model is proposed and a series of these elements are used to describe the contact interface. This new approach allows to implicitly account for the microscale energy dissipation as well as the pressure-dependent contact stiffness caused by the roughness of the contact surface. The proposed model and its predicting capabilities are then evaluated against a simplified blade-damper model, based on an underplatform damper test rig recently developed by the authors. A semi-analytical contact solver is used to tune the parameters of the contact element starting from the profilometer measurements of the real damper surface. A comparison with a more simplistic modelling approach based on macroslip contact elements, highlights the improved accuracy of the new model to predict the experimental nonlinear response, when information about the surface roughness is available.},

  abstract = {Most available wheel/rail interaction models for the prediction of impact forces caused by wheel flats use a Hertzian spring as contact model and do not account for the changes in contact stiffness due to the real three-dimensional wheel flat geometry. In the literature, only little information is available on how this common simplification influences the calculation results. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of contact modelling on simulated impact forces due to wheel flats in order to determine the errors introduced by simplified approaches. For this purpose, the dynamic wheel/rail interaction is investigated with a time-domain model including a three-dimensional (3D) non-Hertzian contact model based on Kalker's variational method. The simulation results are compared with results obtained using a twodimensional (2D) non-Hertzian contact model consisting of a Winkler bedding of independent springs or alternatively a single non-linear Hertzian contact spring. The relative displacement input to the Hertzian model is either the wheel profile deviation due to the wheel flat or the pre-calculated vertical wheel centre trajectory. Both the 2D model and the Hertzian spring with the wheel centre trajectory as input give rather similar results to the 3D model, the former having the tendency to slightly underestimate the maximum impact force and the latter to slightly overestimate. The Hertzian model with the wheel profile deviation as input can however lead to large errors in the result. Leaving aside this contact model, the correct modelling of the longitudinal geometry of the wheel flat is actually seen to have a larger influence on the maximum impact force than the choice of contact model.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the generalized Maxwell model (GMM) identification. The formulation of the transfer function of the GMM is defined, as well as its asymptotes. To compare identification methods of the parameters of the GMM, a test transfer function and two quality indicators are defined. Then, three graphical methods are described, the enclosing curve method, the CRONE method and an original one. But the results of graphical methods are not good enough. Thus, two optimization recursive processes are described to improve the results of graphical methods. The first one is based on an unconstrained non-linear optimization algorithm and the second one is original and allows constraining identified parameters. This new process uses the asymptotes of the modulus and the phase of the transfer function of the GMM. The result of the graphical method optimized with the new process is very accurate and fast.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the adaptation of reduced-order models during simulations of series of elastoviscoplastic problems. In continuation with previous works, this paper aimed at extending the A Priori Hyper-Reduction method (APHR method) for nonlinear thermal problems to nonlinear mechanical problems involving internal variables. This method is an a priori approach because full incremental responses of detailed models are not forecasted in order to build reduced-order models. The recent extension of the Hyper-Reduction method to reduction of mechanical models involving internal variables makes possible the reduction of degrees of freedom and the reduction of integration points. A multi-level formulation is introduced to focus on the capability of the method to perform efficient parallel computations to adapt reduced-order models.},

  abstract = {Recently, the instrumented sleeper has been developed to measure the sleeper response in-situ. An analytical model of the dynamics of railway sleepers has been developed to calculate rapidly the sleeper response under vertical wheel loads. However, lateral wheel loads are not taken into account in this model but would influence the sleeper response. This paper presents a new analytical model of the dynamics of railway sleepers under lateral wheel loads. In this model, the sleeper is considered as a Euler-Bernoulli’s beam resting on a visco-elastic foundation. Thereafter, by combining the relation between the reaction forces and displacements of the periodically supported beam, the sleeper response can be calculated with help of the Green’s function. Finally, the numerical application shows the influence of the laterals wheel load on the sleeper response.},

  abstract = {Les voies ferrées sont endommagées par les chargements dynamiques répétés issus du passage des trains, en particulier pour les trains à grandes vitesses. Structures multicouches complexes, ces voies sont constituées : de rails en acier, de semelles en élastomère, des traverses de béton, d’une couche de ballast et d’une sous-couche. L’étude du comportement mécanique d’une voie ferrée (de chaque composant à la structure entière) est donc étroitement liée à l’amélioration de la sécurité ferroviaire, ainsi qu’à l’efficacité de ce mode de transports.Ce travail de thèse se focalise sur l’étude des semelles sous rail et de la sous-couche en grave bitumineuse. Ces deux composants ont été choisis pour leurs similarités en termes de comportement mécanique non linéaire et capacité de dissipation d’énergie. Ce manuscrit est divisé en trois chapitres.Dans le cadre de ce premier chapitre le modèle d’intégrale par convolution (modèle-CI) est choisi pour modéliser le comportement mécanique du matériau élastomère de la semelle. Le modèle-CI est une extension naturelle de la théorie de la viscoélasticité linéaire, car basé sur l'extension du principe de superposition Boltzmann ; la séparation des contraintes proposée par ce modèle, a été observée expérimentalement par de nombreux auteurs.Le deuxième chapitre concerne l’étude du comportement mécanique du matériau élastomérique qui compose les semelles sous-rail et de modélisation pour prédire le comportement non-linéaire et la capacité d'absorption d'énergie d'une structure semelle.Le modèle de comportement (modèle-CI) permet de représenter de façon très fiable la partie chargement de la semelle (erreur de 1 \% pour la rigidité). Pour la partie déchargement, la représentation est un peu moins bonne : la déformation résiduelle "numérique" est de 2,2 \% alors qu'expérimentalement elle n'est que de 0,4 \%, ce qui conduit à une erreur de prédiction sur l'énergie dissipée de 37.5 \%. La comparaison entre les résultats numériques et expérimentaux in-situ montrent que le modèle utilisé permet de décrire assez correctement la réponse de la semelle au passage d'un train dans les limites d’erreur de prédiction de la déformation résiduelle.Ce modèle-CI doit être utilisé sur le modèle géométrique 3D complet de la semelle, les approches simplifiées (2D, semelle sans rainure) conduisent à des prédictions fortement erronées.Le troisième chapitre se focalise sur l’étude du matériau de type asphalte utilisé pour la couche sous-ballast des voies ferrées. Des cubes de “Matériaux Virtuels” ont été réalisés en disposant aléatoirement des inclusions sphériques monodisperses rigides dans un volume de matrice au comportement hyper-élastique. L’influence du diamètre et de la fraction volumique de ces inclusions sur le comportement mécanique d’une structure a été étudiée numériquement et expérimentalement en utilisant un plan d’expérience de type Doehlert. Cette approche de « Matériaux Virtuels » a permis d’avoir une correspondance exacte entre les géométries des spécimens numériques et expérimentaux sur les 7 échantillons testés.L’analyse des surfaces de réponses a montré que les deux paramètres observés F\_max et E\_\% sont fortement corrélés aux valeurs de V\_fr. L’influence du diamètre des inclusions, par contre, est très faible.Enfin, les simulations par éléments finis ont permis d’étudier la répartition interne des contraintes et déformations. Les résultats ont été présentés pour l’échantillon V0225-D08 : la chaine d’effort a été visualisée à l’intérieur de la matrice et présente des contraintes de Von Mises jusqu’à 8 fois celles obtenues dans la matrice.Dans l’étude proposée, le diamètre et la forme des inclusions ont été fixés. Il serait intéressant de faire varier ces paramètres en utilisant la même méthodologie. Par ailleurs, les récentes avancées en termes de fabrication additive permettent d’imaginer la construction d’échantillons hétérogènes complexes.},
